What 'use client' is, why it exists, how it works, and how to use it.

The 'use client' directive introduces a new dimension to bundling: allowing developers to use the same language and JSX component model for UI concerns that span the client and server. Replacing network synchronization code in multiple languages, routing systems, and frameworks with simple components and props.

This is an excerpt from a conference talk I gave at React Universe.
