Introducing the Codex app—now available on macOS

The Codex app is a powerful command center for building with agents.   

• Multitask effortlessly: Work with multiple agents in parallel and keep agent changes isolated with worktrees
• Create & use skills: package your tools + conventions into reusable capabilities 
• Set up automations: delegate repetitive work to Codex with scheduled workflows in the background

Available starting today on macOS with Windows coming soon.

And for a limited time, Codex is available through ChatGPT Free and Go subscriptions—and we’re doubling rate limits for Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu users—across the Codex app, CLI, IDE extension, and cloud.
