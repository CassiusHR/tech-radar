When you look at scientific tooling, a lot of it hasn’t changed in decades. That’s why we recently launched Prism: a free, AI-native environment for scientific writing and collaboration, designed to mean less time in your editor and more time doing research.

Physicist & Research Scientist Alex Lupsasca joins Kevin Weil (VP, OpenAI for Science) and Victor Powell (Product, Prism) to walk through what it looks like when ChatGPT works inside a LaTeX project with full paper context.

You’ll see Prism:
• polish writing with reviewable edits
• generate a clean diagram from a whiteboard photo
• spin up multiple chat threads to tackle citations and math checks in parallel

Explore Prism and try it on your next draft: https://prism.openai.com
