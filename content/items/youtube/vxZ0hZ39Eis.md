Host Logan Kilpatrick sits down with Ema Taropa, lead of the "Smokejumpers" team, to discuss the infrastructure and serving work behind Gemini. They dive into what it actually takes to serve models to billions of users, why there is no "easy button" for global scaling, and how the team manages the trade-offs between latency, capacity, and cost.

Their conversation covers the origins of the Smokejumpers team, Google’s vertically integrated TPU strategy, and the high-intensity culture of shipping Gemini 3.0. Learn more about the technical challenges of LLM caching and the human stories behind the engineers keeping Google's AI systems running 24/7.
