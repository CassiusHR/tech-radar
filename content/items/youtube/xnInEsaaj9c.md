As AI begins to meaningfully accelerate scientific discovery, we’re taking an early step to reduce friction in day-to-day research work with Prism.

Prism is a free workspace for scientists to write and collaborate on research, powered by GPT-5.2. 

Prism offers unlimited projects and collaborators in a single, cloud-based, LaTeX-native workspace, and is designed to expand access to scientific tools. By reducing version conflicts, manual merging, and mechanical overhead, Prism helps teams spend less time managing files and more time engaging with the substance of their work.

We’re excited to learn from researchers using Prism today and to continue building toward tools that help science move faster — together. 

Prism is now available on the web to anyone with a ChatGPT personal account. Coming soon to ChatGPT Business, Team, Enterprise, and Education plans.
