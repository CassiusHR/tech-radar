Ed Bayes from the Codex team shows how the Codex app pairs with Figma out of the box: prompt with a Figma link and have a working prototype in minutes.

Takeaways:
- One-click install for Figma with the Figma skill.
- Pasting a Figma link is enough to kick off a strong first pass.
- Codex can pull from your design system and get 80-90% there.
- Interactive prototypes are key for building dynamic behavior.

Design-to-code is faster, and AI UX gets easier to stress test.
