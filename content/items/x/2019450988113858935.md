This Next.js application showcases how the x402 protocol enables seamless micropayments for premium content. Users pay $0.10 USDC per video on the Base network, eliminating the need for subscriptions while providing instant, secure transactions.

Built with:
• Next.js 16 & React 19
• TypeScript
• x402 Protocol SDK
• Base Network (Coinbase L2)

This project serves as a reference implementation for developers looking to integrate micropayment functionality into their applications. It demonstrates best practices for Web3 integration, user experience design, and content gating.

I'm open to feedback, contributions, and discussions about the future of content monetization in Web3.
