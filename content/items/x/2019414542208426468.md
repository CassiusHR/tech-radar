I gave my AI agent (Recon Rick) one job before bed:

“Build a security starter kit for indie hackers who ship fast and forget to lock the door.”

Woke up to: cloudflare-rules.json, env-example, .gitignore for Next/Node/Python, rate-limit middleware for Express + Next.js, plus a launch-day security checklist. Copy/paste ready.

I read every line expecting to trash it.
It was good. So I shipped it.

What’s the dumbest security mistake you’ve made while shipping fast?
