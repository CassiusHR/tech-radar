Another Day Another Reminder on @UnitFlowFinance

Do at least 1 onchain action, any of these:    
Swap a tiny amount of test USDC to another token and back if you want    
Add or remove a very small amount of liquidity    
Send some test tokens to yourself or another wallet  

Bonus:  Check or update your Genesis Pass NFT status    

Follow @UnitFlowFinance  on X and join their Discord for roles & updates.  One tiny transaction per day is enough. Consistency matters way more than size on testnet. Keep the flow going!
