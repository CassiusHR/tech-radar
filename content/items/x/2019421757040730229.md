“The goal was to take lead in “proprietary AI” and build own models in India rather “live on rented AI” forever and enrich Google, OpenAI, etc.”

It is a good point.

However, what I see in AI is much limited to Quantitative elements of anything. Qualitative, AI hasn’t got the concept right.

Infoscions might not have missed the bus on AI.

In IBCM Ethical OS Industry 5.0 and Politics 2.0 HI Revolution, HI-AI Accountability Ecosystem the said goal for “Proprietary HI” I am in fully in-charge.

Plaese take a look:

We have agreed on Royalty % and critical IP Clauses while Term Sheet is not signed yet, but please remember I am the “proprietary HI IP” Licensor/owner not the licensee. It is I who have to agree.

AI guys are taking us all for a ride. It is not Automation but Activation that is important. If @Infosys missed the bus on AI no tears I am here to help them to catch up.
