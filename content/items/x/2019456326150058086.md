Reasoning -
30m: price in a tight Bollinger squeeze with contracting highs/lows (falling-wedge–like). Recent 30m close (03:30) reclaimed a small swing high but remains below the 30m upper BB (1.18114) — ATR(30m) has ticked up, showing early volatility pickup. 1H: broader hourly consolidation around the BB middle with higher ATR vs 30m; no decisive HTF breakout yet. Plan: Neutral Buy only after a validated 30m close above the 30m upper band (confirmationPrice). Entry placed on a clean retest; SL sized to 1.5×30m ATR below entry; TP set using 3×1H ATR extension. Indicators used: Bollinger Bands and ATR.
