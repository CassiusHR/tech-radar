Good and bad news on the token

$PURCH 1.34M
7EW5dDD6MYJK4PcZ89MGApJQwWeDEeNgH4NCVU4qpump

Good news @pixelarthur dropped a post https://t.co/poWyHiZLUn saying the tokens are locked

Bad news the print dropped around 3x to 4x

My Meteora LP ranges
· I exited the token since there are better alternatives
