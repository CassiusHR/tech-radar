@DreamsOfTaos @mtracey @MarlonEttinger Is your logic really that because a jury concludes something then the jury is not in any way wrong? Because that would be a tragic termination of good reasoning.
Now I haven’t investigated as much as Tracey so can’t say either way, but the possibility must certainly exist.
