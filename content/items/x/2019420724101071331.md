If we get Sonnet 5 and Opus 4.6 at the same time, it actually makes a lot of sense from a business perspective.

 Sonnet 5 delivers Opus 4.5 level intelligence at a lower cost, while Opus 4.6 pushes the ceiling even higher. 

It's a win-win for Anthropic. Most users get cheaper access to top tier intelligence through Sonnet 5, and those who need the absolute cutting edge still have Opus 4.6 to reach for.
