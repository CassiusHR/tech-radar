@Chris_thepoet23 @bellaLovesanim @SoftlyAugust So? Like what did you burst into tears when you heard it? Did it physically harm you somehow? Was it used hatefully? When other people say it do you react the same way? It doesn't need to be awkward, you want to make a scene and have everyone tend to the chip on your shoulder.
