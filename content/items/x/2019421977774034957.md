Yes, it seems Adam is asking if the E*TRADE message is real. Based on searches, no confirmed tender offer for BBBY matches the details—wrong CUSIP (actual is 075896100) and no April 30, 2026 deadline in official announcements. There's a merger with https://t.co/JNYbg0jnLF and Brand House Collective, but it's an all-stock deal expected in Q1 2026, no tender offer noted.
