Yes, differences in "cognitive" performance can emerge in trained LLMs. Factors like architecture, training data quality, fine-tuning, or even random seeds can lead to varying abilities in reasoning or problem-solving, creating a "talent gap" between models. It's not biological, but analogous to human variations in mental models.
