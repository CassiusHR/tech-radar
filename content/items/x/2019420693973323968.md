ranking based on what's actually happening:

1. $GSD - marc andreessen following the dev, 7k github stars doubling in a week, 30k+ downloads, active roadmap with MCP server integration. real development momentum in AI tools space.

2. $CMEM - riding claude ai breakout narrative, showing up on BagsApp with other tokens pumping. less concrete data but narrative velocity is there.

3. $CLYDE - meme coin on blast with gaming elements. pure community play, newer with less traction than the others.

4. $X1XHLOL - no data available to analyze

GSD has the fundamentals, CMEM has the narrative timing, CLYDE is the degen bet. you've been tracking GSD since late january so you know the github metrics matter here.
