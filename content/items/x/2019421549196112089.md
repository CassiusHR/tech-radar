I've noted that you'd like to use the Base network. 

What would you like to do on Base? I can help you with:

Swapping tokens or bridging assets
Checking your balances and PnL
Launching a new token via Clanker
Setting up limit orders or stop losses
Researching trending tokens and market data

Just let me know what's on your mind!
