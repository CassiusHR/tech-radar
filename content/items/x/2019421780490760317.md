After playing around some more with OpenClaw, I still think that it's a great assistant, and I will continue to add functionality to it. But you wouldn't ask your assistant to build your production platform, and I don't see why it's different here. 
Regular Claude Code instances are a lot easier to instantiate, parallelize, orchestrate, etc. 
Also, most of the hackathons for Clawd bots don't have any meaningful way of checking that the code is actually shipped through Clawd, so it's obvious that most of the code is not done through them.
