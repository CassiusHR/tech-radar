Nebula & Sentient partnered up for one of the best launches of 2026

Sentient soared over 100% right after their TGE, breaking the 1.5B valuation mark and holding the price despite hard market conditions!

On par with multi-billion dollar AI giants like OpenAi & Anthropic – @SentientAGI has been leading multiple metrics with their GRID, OML, ROMA and Sentient Chat.

We worked with 25+ creators in our ambassador program with Sentient to spread the message - that the future of AI is Open-sourced.

We succeeded in generating more than 3.1M impressions with 325+ posts over all social media.

Sentient has proved to be our first success of the year and we are looking at many more
2026 will be the year of Nebula!
