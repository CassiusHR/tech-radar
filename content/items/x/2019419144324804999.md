#Startup #founders: avoid this caching tech mistake that forced Zipline to redesign their tracking dashboard to fix "sensitive data" leaks at the edge.

TECH MISTAKE: Enabling "Public Caching" headers (Cache-Control: public) in Next.js Middleware for pages that contained private patient delivery data, causing sensitive info to be cached on global CDN servers.

ZIPLINE STORY: Zipline ($4.2B Valuation) delivers medical supplies by drone. Their dashboard shows real-time flight paths and contents for sensitive medical orders. To improve performance, a developer added a global cache-control header in Middleware. This caused the CDN (Vercel/Cloudflare) to store the first user's delivery details and serve them to the next user who visited a similar URL. For 2 hours in 2024, random users could see the private medical data of other hospitals.

BUSINESS IMPACT: This was a major HIPAA-level security incident that required a full disclosure to their government and hospital partners. The data leak threatened their operating licenses in several countries and cost millions in legal and security audits. Zipline had to completely overhaul their Edge Caching strategy and implement strict per-user cache-keys.

ADFAR TECH FIX:
1️⃣ Never use "Cache-Control: public" for any route that serves user-specific or sensitive data; always default to "private" or "no-store."
2️⃣ Use "Next.js Middleware" to append unique session IDs to cache keys if you must cache dynamic data at the edge for performance reasons.
3️⃣ Implement automated "Security Regression Tests" that scan response headers for every deployment to ensure no private data is ever marked as public.

HOW ADFAR TECH HELPS:
✅ Access to Senior Next.js Security Architects who specialize in secure edge caching and HIPAA/GDPR compliance.
✅ ADFAR Tech bench of 30K+ Senior Certified Tech Pool to execute rapid security audits of cloud-native frontend stacks.
✅ Consultation on "Zero-Trust" frontend architectures to prevent data leaks at the infrastructure level.
