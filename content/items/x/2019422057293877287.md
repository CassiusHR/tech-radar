4. THE INTELLECTUAL: Anthropic (Claude Opus 4.5)

You’re the high-fashion editorial girl. You don’t do "drama," you do Coding. You do Safety. You’re arguably the smartest girl in the room, but sometimes you’re a little too quiet. The judges love your ethics, but in a market that wants "Viral Chaos," can you survive without a "Fun Mode"?
