You wanna see Doma on DexScreener? 👀

Community’s pushing to get Doma added so domain tokens show up directly there.

If you’ve got 30 seconds, jump into the DexScreener Discord, verify, head to chain listing, and drop support for Doma. https://t.co/E76Rm9Oegc

Small action, big visibility. This is how ecosystems grow. Let’s make some noise.
