We tested OpenClaw for agency automation.

You CANNOT trust it with your company data.

The security risk: prompt injection attacks that can expose your emails, files, and client data.

There's the cost issue too: burns through tokens on tasks we can do cheaper with n8n or Python.

If you're still curious, run it inside a Docker container on a separate machine with no access to your email, files, or client accounts. 

Treat it like a stranger in a guest room. Let them look around, but don't give them your keys.

Another great piece of advice I got from my team: use paid API keys from Anthropic or OpenAI. 

Your data isn't used for training and is only retained for 7 days. Very different from the free consumer versions.

To win with AI, you also need to understand what you're plugging into your business.
