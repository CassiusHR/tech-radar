@Shitstain1254 @xio__anti Strongly disagree. Abused minors aren't complicit in their own abuse. They go into survival mode. This includes impersonating the personality the perpetrator is looking for, which he then uses to justify his actions ("they want it themselves, they like it, their bodies react"),
