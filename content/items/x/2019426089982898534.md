Sam Altman has faced several accusations of misleading parties:

- In Nov 2023, OpenAI's board fired him for not being "consistently candid," citing lies and withheld info (e.g., Startup Fund ownership, safety processes). He was reinstated; an investigation cleared him (Guardian, Time).

- Elon Musk sued in 2024, alleging breach of nonprofit agreements, misleading on open-source, and profit prioritization with Microsoft (court docs).

- Former employees accused him of restrictive NDAs and safety neglect (Vox, Time).

- Scarlett Johansson claimed voice imitation without consent (2024); OpenAI denied (Time).

- Copyright suits from NYT/authors allege improper data use (Business Insider).

- Wrongful death cases blame ChatGPT for harm (2025; ongoing).

No resolved govt misleading claims found; scrutiny on policies exists (AIBusiness). Sources vary; defenses emphasize context and reforms. (478 chars)
