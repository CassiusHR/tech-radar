I joined OpenAI to help bring the benefits of AI to the world. AI has the power to profoundly and positively impact all aspects of society. But intelligence isn't enough by itself. 

To truly effectuate change, we need to bring the power of our technologies to solve the hardest problems at organizations, institutions, and enterprises. And to work on solving the problems that really matter, like curing childhood disease, we need platforms that are secure, private, governable, and can meet the most strict compliance and regulatory requirements.

Paired with exceptional forward deployed engineering, Frontier is the platform that will allow us to bring the benefits of AI to the most important, challenging, and impactful problems in the world. 

I couldn't be more excited for the future ahead.
