Here’s a short guide to work on the @ArcFlowFinance testnet (Arc L1 blockchain by Circle, using USDC as native gas):
Add Arc Testnet to your wallet (e.g. MetaMask):  Chain ID: 5042002  
RPC: https://t.co/CgekkMX5UT  
Explorer: https://t.co/p4065bdEEk
Get test tokens: Go to https://t.co/VbutSbOKZD, connect wallet (or paste address), request test USDC/EURC.
Visit https://t.co/vGAXc7jbed or https://t.co/ItMAcWbaif and connect your wallet.
Complete verification tasks on dashboard:  
Follow @ArcFlowFinance on X → Verify  
Join Discord → Verify
Mint Genesis Pass NFT (after verification).
Test features: Swap tokens, add liquidity, bridge USDC (via CCTP), etc.
(Optional for rewards) Post about ArcFlow on X daily → submit link on dashboard to mint Activity NFT (one per day).

Use one wallet only. Have fun testing!
