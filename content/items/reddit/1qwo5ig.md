When I first got introduced to [ik\_llama.cpp](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp) I struggled to run it because builds were not available and I didn’t have time/experience to set up a build environment on Windows (the env I use, don't ask me why).  
To make onboarding easier for others in the same boat, I created and publish pre-built releases from my fork so folks can try ik\_llama.cpp without wrestling with compilation — in the hope that more people will adopt it.
