I am from Europe, I've over 7 years of experience as software engineer with finished computer science bachelor and master degree, at the moment I have a contract that will end in one month, and I really struggle to find another contract or side gigs, I would even accept rates like 15-20 eur / h or ... doing projects for small prices, it's a bit depressing not gonna lie, sorry for rant.
