Most modern frameworks follow the same mantra: UI is a function of state: UI = f(state).  

You change a variable, and the UI jumps to the new result. If state changes from A to B, the UI immediately renders B. The problem? Modern UX isn’t a snapshot rather it is a journey. Transitions, animations, and async flows are usually added as an afterthought or handled via state hacks (boolean flags like isAnimating).
