Hey Redditors!

I'm a Node.js core collaborator, and my team and I have finally been grinding away to bring the Node.js docs into this decade (finally… 😅).

We’d love to hear about your pain points with this redesign, or just the documentation in general, so we can iron out a final draft for y’all!

Thanks in advance!
