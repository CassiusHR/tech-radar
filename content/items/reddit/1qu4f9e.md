The textbook process is:   
  
1. literature review   
2. implement baseline  
3. run ablations  
4. iterate.   
  
But I feel like this misses something? I've noticed the best researchers seem to know what will work before they even run experiments. Like they have some intuition I'm missing.   
  
Is it just pattern recognition from years of failed experiments? Or is there something else, like spending way more time understanding why baselines fail, or choosing better problems to work on in the
