Last week I found myself down the rabbit hole or porting Quake's source code to Javascript and Three.js using Claude Code.

It has been a lot of prompting work and I've learnt a bunch of amazing tricks. Definitely recommend everyone to do a project like this.

I'm now in the process of adding Multiplayer mode 🤞
