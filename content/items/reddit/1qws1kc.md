Our smartest model got an upgrade. Opus 4.6 plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, operates reliably in massive codebases, and catches its own mistakes.

Opus 4.6 is state-of-the-art on several evaluations including agentic coding, multi-discipline reasoning, knowledge work, and agentic search.

Opus 4.6 can also apply its improved abilities to a range of everyday work tasks: running financial analyses, doing research, and using and creating documents, spreadsheets, and present
