I’m making this post because when I was looking for info, nobody could give me a straight answer on what to expect from a $100 budget. So, here is exactly what I managed to achieve:

* **Built 3 MVP projects** (MERN Stack).
* **Fully released 1 project** to production.
* **Experimented with browser game development.**
* Mostly used **Opus** at the start, then switched to **Sonnet**.
* **Content Creation:** Generated social media posts and scripts for videos.
* **Long-form writing:** Wrote articl
