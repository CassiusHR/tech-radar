Good day, folks!

I kept catching myself recreating the same CSS grid layouts over and over again, so I decided to build a tiny web tool to speed this up.

Pro Grid Generator lets you visually configure a grid (columns, gaps, layout) and instantly get clean, copy-paste-ready CSS. No accounts, no paywalls, just a quick utility you can open when you need it.

**Why I built it:**

* I wanted something fast, minimal, and dev
