Growing tired of these audit cycles. We plan ahead and just when we think we’re ready senior engineers get dragged into explaining configs, workflows and edge cases that technically exist but aren’t documented in the most formal way.

  
It’s not wrong but it’s disruptive and hard to schedule around delivery. We want audits to be predictable not ifs buts and maybes.

  
How do we relieve the eng team of this work?
