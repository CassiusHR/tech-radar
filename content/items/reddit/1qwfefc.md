Hi everyone.
First of all, English is not my native language. I have never studied it in a formal way, so I mostly learned by intuition and by using it when it was necessary
I’m a Uruguayan full-stack developer with around 6 years of experience.
My main stack is React and JavaScript, and I also work a lot with PHP and APIs.
I’ve built everything from reusable components to complete production systems.
My problem is not technical, it’s finding a good opportunity.
Most of the offers I find locally
