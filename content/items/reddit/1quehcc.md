**From April 2025 to January 2026, I worked through** [**Frankel’s "The Geometry of Physics".**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/294139.The_Geometry_of_Physics)

The goal wasn’t to “relearn physics”, but to rebuild a modern geometric toolbox and see which mature ideas from geometry and topology might still be underused in machine learning.

The book develops a large amount of machinery—manifolds, differential forms, connections and curvature, Lie groups and algebras, bundles, gauge theory, v
