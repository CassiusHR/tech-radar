With the new Ace-Step 1.5 music generation model and the awesome developer of the tools:

https://github.com/Haervwe/open-webui-tools

With a beefy GPU (24GB) you can use a decent LLM like GPT-OSS:20b or Ministral alongside the full ace step model and generate music on the go!

I hope you guys found it awesome and star his github page, he has so many good tools for openwebui!

We are at a point where you can hook up Flux Klein for image generation and image editing, use ace step to create music,
