Hi to all of you guys, I work on a big company that runs classic old "Failover Clusters in Windows" and we have Kubernetes in our sight.

In our team we feel that Kubernetes is the right step but don have experience. So we would like to ask you guys some questions. All questions for BareMetal or OnPrem VMs.

* How did you guys do GitOps for infrastructure things? Like define the metrics server

* For on premise TalosOS right?

* For local storage and saving SqlServer, SMB or NFS? Other options?
