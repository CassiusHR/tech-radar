The new prefetch behavior in 16 is causing insane increases in hosting fees compared to 15.

Not only that but it seems 16 can start 4 prefetch requests for a single page.

Also navigation is blocked when users click a link before the prefetch request completes

Some users are reporting Next 16 increases their requests count by 700% and bills increasing by 800$!  
  
It seems the only way to combat this is to completely disable prefetching in the Link component or only enable it on mouse hover.
