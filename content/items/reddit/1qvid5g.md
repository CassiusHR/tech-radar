spent the last month designing a hybrid AWS/GCP setup that optimizes for cost and resilience. used GCP for our data pipeline and ML workloads, AWS for application hosting and compute. included proper failover, cross region redundancy, the whole thing.  
presented it yesterday and got the usual questions. "isn't this too complex?" "what if something breaks between clouds?" "why not just stay on AWS?"

i have good answers for all of this but now i'm wondering if i'm overcomplicating things. maybe
