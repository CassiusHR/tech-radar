With how many companies are rushing to plug everything into ChatGPT and other AI tools, feels like it's only a matter of time before we see a massive breach tied to AI usage.

Samsung surely was a wakeup call but that was just employees being careless. I'm thinking more like a provider getting compromised or training data getting leaked that exposes customer info from thousands of companies at once.

anyone in security thinking about this? feels like we're building a house of cards...
