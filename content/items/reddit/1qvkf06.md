I set up a multi node Kubernetes cluster at home on Multipass VMs with kubeadm. I also added Grafana and Node Exporter for monitoring and Argo CD for GitOps deployments.   
  
Would recruiters think this was real work experience?  
  
Should I show it as a homelab, a personal project, or as real DevOps work experience?
