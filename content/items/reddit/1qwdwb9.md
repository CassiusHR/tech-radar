Hi everyone! 👋

Over the past few days, I’ve been working on Tabularis, a lightweight yet feature-rich database manager.

The idea came from my frustration with existing tools: many of them felt bloated, heavy, and not particularly enjoyable to use. I needed something fast, responsive, and with a clean UX.

Tabularis is built with Rust + Tauri on the backend and React + TypeScript on the frontend, aiming to stay lean without sacrificing power.

Feel free to take a look!
