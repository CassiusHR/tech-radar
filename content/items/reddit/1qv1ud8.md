Hi everyone 

A few months ago I made a post on the git subreddit and the most upvoted comment was asking for [kubectl](https://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/1ofaqag/comment/nl8xr19/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) so I thought I'd share this here if folks are interested.

We've built a typing application where you can practice typing with almost every programming language, and some cli tools.
