The vLLM team just released the vLLM-Omni paper on arXiv: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02204](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02204)

vLLM-Omni is designed for any-to-any multimodal models that jointly handle text, images, video, and audio — which is where serving starts to get really painful in practice.

It documents their system design for serving *any-to-any multimodal models* — think pipelines that mix AR LLMs, diffusion models, encoders, etc., instead of assuming a single paradigm.

A few things
