I currently use Supabase as database host and authentication provider. I’m planning to completely migrate away from Supabase and I want to now if I’m doing it the right way.

The reason I want to migrate away from Supabase is for control and to avoid vendor lock-in. I don’t use most of the features Supabase has to offer (edge functions, storage, realtime, etc.)

# Here’s my plan:

*Estimated time: 4-6 weeks*

# Phase 1

\- Setup Prisma ORM and pull schema

\- manage migrations via Prisma

\- use
