I have this problem with my paper, where the arXiv version is in Google Scholar but not the ACL proceedings version. I looked up and found that there is at least one other paper with the same problem:

[https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.91/](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.91/)

[https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1112](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1112)

Does anyone else have the same problem? What could be the reason?
