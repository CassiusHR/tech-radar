The news about the $1B push for compute infrastructure in Texas is a massive milestone for the ecosystem. It's clear that the hunger for scale isn't slowing down in 2026.

However, it raises an interesting technical challenge: **How do we maintain this pace of innovation while addressing the constraints of energy, latency, and data sovereignty?**

While the "Hyperscale" route solves for raw power, we’ve been working on the "Edge" route. 

The goal isn’t to replace the cloud, but to enable:
