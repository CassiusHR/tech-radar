How much time does testing usually add to your overall development process? I sometimes feel like I’m testing things that are very obvious, and if I test something at the unit level, I’m not sure whether I should test it again in integration and E2E. I’d love to hear how others approach this in real projects."

For those of you building full-stack apps, how do you usually handle testing? Do you test everything you build, or only the critical parts? How much time does testing usually add to your overall development process? I sometimes feel like I’m testing things that are very obvious, and if I test something at the unit level, I’m not sure whether I should test it again in integration and E2E. I’d love to hear how others approach this in real projects.
