Been thinking about how Uncle Bob's SOLID principles apply now that we're all using AI coding assistants.

The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) from Bertrand Meyer: "Software systems should allow behavior to be changed by adding new code, rather than changing existing code."

This hits different in 2025. Here's why:

When you're using Claude/Copilot/whatever, it's SO easy to just ask it to "fix this module" and let it regenerate 500 lines. But that's exactly what OCP warns against. You're:
