Hi everyone.

I was working on a mid-size i18n project at my company where the translation files had thousands of lines in it.

writing new keys, switching between locales and editing existing keys was getting harder and harder. so I built an open-source extension to help me with the i18n workflow. and it went so well.

So I decided to open-source it so everyone can use it.

The idea was simple, internationalization feel like a native part of your editor, this are the features list:
