I've been using the **Deep research** function from ChatGPT quite a lot since it came out.

I love it, but every month I use the limit in the first 2-3 days... so I was wondering if anyone else has any tips or setups they use for running something similar to Deep research -- on local LLM.

I have a decent setup of 3x3090, so I can run big-ish models (gpt-oss-120b or GLM Air) at VRAM speed or 30b models in Q8 (if precision is more important for deep research).

I've been using OpenWebUI + local S
