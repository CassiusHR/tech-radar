I'm curious how others handle this specific workflow challenge:                                                                    

When Claude Code is running agents, I'm stuck in this weird limbo where:

*   I can't fully step away because things occasionally need manual intervention
*   I can't give full autonomous control because, well, agents can sometimes go off the rails
*   But I also have long stretches of just... waiting. Pressing Enter. Watching.
