Anyone else having problems with extended thinking? I use opus 4.5 and have extended thinking on and i've never had a problem. I've been using claude daily for the last few months but today it seems sort of random if extended thinking actually works or not. I have one conversation where it wont work no matter what I do. I use the app and the website but mostly the app.
