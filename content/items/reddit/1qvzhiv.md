Some days I spend more time talking about reliability than actually improving it.

Standups, syncs, postmortems, pre-mortems, planning, re-planning, alignment calls... and by the time I get a quiet hour, I'm already drained.

get that communication matters, but at some point the work needs focus.

How do you protect deep work time without looking "unavailable"?
