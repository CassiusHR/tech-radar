Hi r/LocalLLaMA! 

I built Codag - an open source VSCode extension to visualize LLM workflows natively in your codebase. I kept on getting lost with the sheer amount of code that agents were output, and what better way of keeping track than to visualize it? 

It supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI + more, and works with Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java + more.   
  
The demo video visualizes Vercel's AIChatbot repo.
