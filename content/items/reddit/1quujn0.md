Currently I have a 3 node microk8s cluster on top of my Proxmox cluster, and I want to move that to Talos OS based kubernetes, for several reasons, but main one is just to try it and experiment it in a more real state.

  
Currently I don't have any GitOps approach that I know it would simplify a lot the situation, and I have mainly helm based deployments and some microk8s addons, and a external CEPH cluster configuration and some NFS storage class as well.

  
Anyone has done something similar
