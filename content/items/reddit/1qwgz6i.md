This is the follow-up to my account suspension post from 2 days ago that got 164K views.

Eric G from AWS Executive Escalations sent my documents to Trust &amp; Safety for review. That was his last message. It's been 2 days of complete silence since then.

No response on the support portal. No response from the multiple AWS support reps who were tagged here and on LinkedIn. Nothing. Just silence while my startup sits completely offline.

We made the decision yesterday to migrate everything to GC
