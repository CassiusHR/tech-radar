Hi everyone,

I’m a second-year Computer Science undergrad and I wanted to share my situation – maybe someone has been in a similar spot or has solid advice.

I came from a non-scientific high school (very little math background). When I started university, I basically had to catch up on years of algebra, calculus, etc., in just a few months.

My grades in Analysis weren’t great at first (which I think is understandable), but I didn’t give up: I studied a lot and managed to do well in Statistics
