Hey r/LocalLLaMA,

Here's something new for you: Mobile World Models.  
We just released gWorld — open-weight visual world models for mobile GUIs (8B and 32B).

**Demo Video Explanation:**

Here's gWorld 32B imagining a multi-step Booking dot com session — zero access to the real app:  
1. Sees flight search form (Detroit → Chicago)  
2. Click "Search" → writes code → renders full results page with airlines, prices, times  
3. Click destination field → predicts the search UI with history
