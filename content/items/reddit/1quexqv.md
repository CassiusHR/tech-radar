Bot detection through keystroke rhythm. No CAPTCHAs, no interruptions.

Traditional CAPTCHAs aren't cutting it anymore against modern AI/browser tools, and honestly, I don't want to block agents completely anyway; they're part of the future. Just want to softly penalize them in our recommendation algorithm's score, so real users don't get hurt.

Made this quick TS lib: **is-human-cadence**

* Tracks only timing/rhythm: pauses, speed changes, backspaces, burst patterns (no text content analyzed)
