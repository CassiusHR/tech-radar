Have a new grad frontend interview in like 2 days, I have honestly never done a frontend interview, only full stack ones which hardly tested frontend specific questions. What is the best way to prepare and most frequent questions you get/ask? I mainly just went through websites like geeks for geeks on common frontend questions. I also only know React, no knowledge of Vue or Angular, is this ok? Interview is for a chinese gaming company (hoyoverse) which has a notoriously difficult interview.
