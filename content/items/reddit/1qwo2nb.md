"Vibe-coding" made sense when it was about prompting Lovable to spit out a todo app at 2 am for fun.

But now that we're using AI to ship production code, fix bugs in minutes that would take hours, and prototype features before writing specs. Feels weird calling that "vibes."

The term carries this implication that you're not really coding, just messing around.

Meanwhile half of us are using Claude Code as a legit productivity tool.

What do you call it when you're actually building real things
