Sharing DeepBrainz-R1 — a family of reasoning-first small language models aimed at agentic workflows rather than chat.



These models are post-trained to emphasize:

\- multi-step reasoning

\- stability in tool-calling / retry loops

\- lower-variance outputs in agent pipelines



They’re not optimized for roleplay or creative writing. The goal is predictable reasoning behavior at small parameter sizes for local / cost-sensitive setups.



Models:

\- R1-4B (flagship)

\- R1-2B

\- R1-0.6B-v2
