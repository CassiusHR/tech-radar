INVITE: https://discord.gg/rC922KfEwj

There used to be one old discord server for the subreddit but it was deleted by the previous mod.

Why?
The subreddit has grown to 500k users - inevitably, some users like a niche community with more technical discussion and fewer memes (even if relevant).

We have a discord bot to test out open source models.

Better contest and events organization.

Best for quick questions or showcasing your rig!
