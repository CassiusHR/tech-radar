We operate an infrastructure startup focused on large-scale image and video generation.  
Because we run these models in real production pipelines we repeatedly encounter the same issues:

* fragile prompt following
* broken composition in long or constrained prompts
* hallucinated objects and incorrect text rendering
* manual, ad-hoc iteration loops to “fix” generations

The underlying models are strong. The failure mode is not model capacity, but the lack of *explicit reasoning and verificatio
