I've been making apps with node.js based frameworks for a while and with nest.js I gained an interest in the internal workings of node.js itself however I have no clue outside of reading the docs. 

Question A: Are the docs enough to make me understand the internals of node.js
Question B: How much c++ do i need to know
Question C: What are some other resources I can use?
