I am a fullstack developer with React as my primary frontend stack. I transitioned from a backend development role. I started with writing inline css when I was a beginner. I slowly understood the problems with inline and internal css as I grew. I finally reached a state where I started to maintain css classes and files. Creating a css file for a component became my instinct. And then came Tailwind CSS. For me, it felt like going back to writing inline css. I haven't used it so I might be wrong
