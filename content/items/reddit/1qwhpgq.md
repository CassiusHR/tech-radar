Hi all. Got a client (UK) asking for examples of what I'd consider "excellent" websites in terms of super clear UX/UI, great performance and very secure.

Their site is going to be very informational, like a knowledge hub / documentation. They're throwing around the idea of having zero JS...

So far Ive got:

gov.uk for performance/security

mozilla.org for the same

Struggling to think of a site that has really clear UX...

Can anyone chuck some ideas my way?

Thanks
