Hi,

I’m curious about **real experiences** from devs who’ve sold websites, either to clients or as finished products.

Questions I had:

* What kind of sites sold best?
* Time spent building vs finding a buyer/client
* How pricing compared to effort
* Did build method matter? (custom code vs WP/Elementor vs AI tools)

Not looking for tutorials exactly, just honest reflections from people who’ve done it.

Thanks.
