After completing Andrew Ng's course, CS229, various math and ML stuff and also CS231n, I struggled to find quality practice problems. So I built Neural Forge:



\- Currently, 73 questions across all ML topics

\- Code directly in browser (Python via Pyodide)

\- Spaced repetition for retention

\- Instant test case validation

\- Knowledge graph showing prerequisites

\- 8 question types (MCQ, debug code, implement algorithms, design architectures, math derivations, case studies, paper implemen
