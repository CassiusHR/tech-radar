Hey folks,  
This will be my first time attending KubeCon (Amsterdam), and honestly, it feels a bit overwhelming.

So many talks, so many booths, side events, hallway conversations… I’m worried about making the classic mistake: running around all day and leaving with a backpack full of stickers but zero real takeaways.

For those who’ve been before:  
What actually *matters*?

* Is it better to focus on talks or hallway chats?
* Any must-avoid traps for first-timers?
* How do you decide which se
