A few days ago I shared [Kubeli](https://github.com/atilladeniz/kubeli) here and got mass great feedback. Since then I've been heads-down implementing the most requested features:

**What's new:**

\- Windows support - finally cross-platform (macOS + Windows, Linux coming)

\- Tab navigation with drag &amp; drop - manage multiple clusters/resources side by side, reorder tabs freely

\-Flux CD support - native HelmReleases and Kustomizations views

\- AI integration - Claude Code CLI and OpenAI C
