Hey r/reactjs! 👋

I've spent way too many hours debugging prop drilling issues. You know the drill:

1. Find a prop with wrong value
2. Search codebase for prop name → 47 results
3. Manually trace through components
4. 20 minutes later, find the issue

So I built **PropFlow** \- a VS Code extension that does this instantly.

# What it does

Hover over ANY prop → see complete lineage from source to usage.

Features:

* 🔍 Instant prop tracing (2 seconds vs 20 minutes)
* 🗺️ Visual flowcharts on
