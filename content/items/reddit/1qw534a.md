[This article](https://itnext.io/understanding-the-ingress-nginx-deprecation-before-you-migrate-to-the-gateway-api-fbf2ad0443bc?source=friends_link&amp;sk=2f870f5a1065374ccc74a146158f4a02) is a practical, enterprise-grade migration guide with real-world examples. It’s based on real enterprise setup, built on top of the [kubara ](https://www.kubara.io/)framework. It documents how we approached the migration, what worked, what didn’t, and — just as important — what we decided not to migrate.
